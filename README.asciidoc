== Programming
=== Packages
* math - used for calculating different math equasions for omni motion
* random - to make random choices
* enum - used to make a state machine for movemnt and colours
* time - for different timers, for example if robot is in FIND_BALL state for 3 seconds then it changes the state
* pyrealsense2 - camera's library
* threading - to make second thread for referee commands client
* json - string manipulation
* websockets - for client and referee server connection
* asyncio - for referee commands client 
* serial - needed for coding usb communication
* struct - for packing information that is sent to the motherboard
* serial.tools.list_ports - to check for available usb ports, so we don't have to find the correct port's name manually
* jit_functions - used it in image processing, jit makes for loops much faster so we can go through lists much faster
* numpy - for list manipulation
* cv2 - image processing
* tkinter - used it in the beginning to simulate omnimotion visually
* websockets - to make our testing server for referee commands

=== A brief description of your game logic and overall code structure.

Our code overall is section into files according to their usage (for example immage_processing.py and movement.py) to make the code less clutterd then if it was all in the same file. The fails contain mainly different classes and then we can import them according to our needs. The main code is structured so that every situatsion has a State that we can refere to to make the robot move accordingly.

=== Good and bad

* One of our code's strong side is sigmoid controller. It eliminated most of the if else sentences and also made the robot's movement better.
* Ball dedection and depth dedection could be improved by using better and more calculations.
* Timer that we used could be made into a function to make the code more compact.
* Line dedection is very reliable.
* Code was good enough to win DeltaX.


== Electronics

The electronics of the robot use the components that were recommended and provided by the instrucors.
The mainboard can control 3 motors and 2 servos. The motor drivers are powered by a 4S LiPo battery and the microcontroller side is powered through the usb connector by the NUC computer. The USB connection is also used to communicate between the microcontroller and the computer. There is a connector for an IR sensor to detect the ball in the holder. The microcontroller will let the computer know when the IR sensor detects a ball.

=== Some problems that occured and the final outcome
* After soldering all the components, there was a problem with the 5V on the battery side of the board. It turned out that one of the pins of the switching regulator was not connected.
* Some of the PWM and DIR pins connections were swapped. Needed to hack the board to fix it.
* Micro USB connector broke and had to be replaced.
* IR sensor wire broke during the robot assembly and it needed to be fixed.

* Everyting worked in the end and we won Delta-X and the course competition.

=== Wheels design
* Nudges to hold the rollers in place 
* Quite generic wheels 

=== Hull Design:
* Thrower moved close to centre of the robot to help with aiming accuracy

== Personal comments

=== Robert:
==== On which parts of the robot did you work on?
I worked on robot's code. Mainly on the driving and calculations logic.

===== What did you learn?
I learned to be better code writer and also learned about different python packages. 

===== What would you do differently next time?
I would make a plan how I want to implement the code and how exactly the robot should work.

===== What did you like/did not like about the course/building a robot?
I liked the practical experience. Also enjoyed the competitive vibe. Maybe those presentations were kind of time wasters.

===== Suggestions for next year students.
Get the robot moving as soon as possible so you get motivation to improve it during the course.

===== Suggestions for instructors.
I don’t have any suggestions or reproaches for the instructors.

=== Argo:
==== On which parts of the robot did you work on?
I worked on robot's code. Mainly on image processing.

===== What did you learn? 
I learned alot of different techniques to improve and optimise my code. Also bettered my coding habits to make code that is less prone to errors and keep my coding structure more clear.

===== What would you do differently next time?
Start earlier and make a structured plan going forward. Also follow the guide and requirements given to us on writing clear and structured code more precisely.

===== What did you like/did not like about the course/building a robot?
I liked buliding the robot from ground up and really enjoyed the programming process, trying to problem solve and make our robot better.

===== Suggestions for next year students.
The given code by the instructors may be overwhelming at first but step by step you get the hang of it. Always aske questions and help from the instructors if you don't understand something.

===== Suggestions for instructors.
The instructors were helpful and for me every thing went smoothly so I don't have any suggestions.

=== Marc:

=== Raimo:
==== On which parts of the robot did you work on?
I worked on the electronics and the firmware of the robot.

===== What did you learn?
I learned to use Altium Designer. I also learned more about electronics and pcb design. Also I learned how to use the STM32CubeIDE and to write firmware for the stm32 microcontroller.

===== What would you do differently next time?
I would try to design the electronics a little earlier so that there would be a bit more time to fix the issues that will pop up.

===== What did you like/did not like about the course/building a robot?
I liked the practical experience. I also liked that the instructors were always ready to help. I would have liked to have a bit more time to work on the robot before the competition.

===== Suggestions for next year students.
I recommend starting with the electronics design early.

===== Suggestions for instructors.
I don't have any suggestions for the instructors.
