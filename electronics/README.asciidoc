## Information

The mainboard is controlled through a STM32G441KBT6 microcontroller. It uses the USB connector to communicate with computer. The microcontroller is powered by the USB connector through a 5V to 3.3V voltage regulator(NCP164CSN330T1G). It can be programmed through the programmer connector with a STLINK programmer.

The board has two isolated sides with their own seperate ground planes. 2 MAX14930DASE+ isolators and 1 MAX12930EASA+ isolator connect both sides. The microcontroller sends signals through the isolators to the motor drivers, servos and the thrower.

The microcontroller side has a debug LED which can be controlled through the microcontroller.

The driver side has 3 PDRV8243HRXYQ1 motor drivers which can power 3 DC motors. The motor drivers need an nsleep signal from the microcontroller to wake up. The drivers are controlled with a direction signal and a PWM signal. The direction pin determines which way the motor spins.

The driver side also has a switching regulator (TPS62933DRLR) which converts the input voltage to 5V for the isolators and servos.

### Microcontroller side:
* Powered trough a micro USB connector.
* It has USB protection.

### The motor driver side:
* Input voltage up to 16.8V.
* Input has reverse voltage protection.
* Motor driver current output up to 2.77A.
